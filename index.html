                        <p>"Greetings, traveler, scholar or perhaps adventurer. Whatever you are, fate has allowed you
                            to transcends realms and enter a pocket between worlds. Yours, and mine. For what purpose
                            I cannot say. Yet, I feel a strange sense of nostalgia. The universe is a mysterious thing,
                            is it not? That I would live to see this day, is astonishing. And, I am sure you have many
                            tales to tell, just like me. Nothing lasts forever, even gods have an end. Mine is waiting
                            for me just beyond. Be weary traveler, world seeker, one who transcends our seams of
                            reality, for this world you will peek into is dangerous. It is a world of treachery,
                            magical beasts and eternal souls. Be prepared, or return whence you came. I leave here all
                            my knowledge of this world, of my home. Of this land and sea."</p><br>
