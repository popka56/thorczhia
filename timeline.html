                    <h2>Age of Creation</h2>
                    <p>First, there was Partum, The God of Creation, who created the world in its image.
                        Then, Bekilip The Destroyer came to lay the world to ruin, but was stopped by the
                        third; Meiva, The God of Balance. Both the creator and the destroyer were then
                        sealed deep within two temples on the planet's crust. Soon after, Meiva conceived
                        the first living beings as a tribute to The First One, what later became known as
                        dragons. And thus began the Age of Dragons.<br><br>

                        Nothing is truly certain regarding Thorczhia's origin. However, the story about the
                        three great Dragon Gods is what most considers to be the truth.</p>

                    <h2>Age of Dragons</h2>
                    <p>The Age of Dragons is the earliest age to have involved the race of men. Historians
                        believe it to have lasted for about 10,000 years. Much of what happened is solely
                        based on speculation or rumors. Since most dragons are now dead, and are not able
                        to speak the common tongue, it is very difficult to do any type of research
                        regarding this age. The dragons who still draw breath however can clearly recall
                        the important events from that seemingly forgotten age.</p>

                    <h3>The Beginning</h3>
                    <p>The first among the dragons was Meakrix, followed by Vis and Neban. Meiva taught
                        them the way of life and death, it showed the three all that the world had to offer.
                        With time Meiva made many more dragons to roam the Earth. Together with the first
                        three, The God of Balance led them. Still, once the Meiva saw that they could handle
                        themselves, it left the dragons to prosper for themselves. Because of this, the
                        dragons proclaimed the most intelligent and powerful dragon as their new leader,
                        Meakrix.<br><br>

                        After having seen the dragons prosper, becoming more intelligent and stronger by day,
                        Meiva bestow upon the dragons a gift. They were given the humans. Humanity had no
                        will of their own but were excellent laborers. They made work for the dragons, and
                        soon the dragons never had to do anything by themselves.</p>

                    <h3>The Middle</h3>
                    <p>Time passed, the humans slowly changed shape depending on their work, some began to
                        crawl on all four, some gained wings and others even evolved ways to breathe
                        underwater. But the dragons started to grow weary of their luxurious life. There was
                        no longer any joy to be had. One day, the dragons all met to discuss how to get rid
                        of their boredom. Their leader, Meakrix, came with the suggestion to try and
                        experimenting with the forest folk, to see if they could give the humans a will of
                        their own. Most were in favor, however Vis, disagreed on this proposition. Vis
                        thought it to be too dangerous and persuaded many to lose faith in the idea. The
                        dragons had a long debate but could not come to a final agreement. So, they decided
                        to solve it with a duel of honor. Meakrix and Vis would be left alone on a secluded
                        island were they would fight to the death. The winner could then decide which route
                        to take. It was to be an honorable duel, no tricks or personal grudges were to be
                        held during this fight. They fought for twelve days and twelve nights. The returning
                        dragon was Meakrix. In honor of their dead friend, the dragons carved out an enormous
                        rock and pierced Vis body with it, creating its tomb.<br><br>

                        Thus, the dragons cast a powerful magic on the the forest folk, granting them a will
                        of their own. They named these new laborers The Atelyas. These new humans soon began
                        to get greedy. The Atelyas thought of themselves much better than any other of the
                        laborers. They felt they did not need to work and instead forced it upon others. When
                        they had children with the lesser beings their children inherited a will of their own
                        as well. And so, more and more stopped working and soon people started complaining.
                        Fighting ensued, people questioned the authority of the dragons and it all slowly
                        descended in to chaos. The dragons blamed Meakrix. After banishing their leader for
                        2,500 years the dragons took action. Neban, as the new dragon leader, ordered the
                        death of all Atelyas. After slaughtering all The Atelyas the dragons swore to never
                        give such a powerful tool to other beings ever again. However, the power of free will
                        had already spread too far and it was easy to hide among the laborers without. The
                        dragons did not want to kill needlessly, because of this Neban determined to let the
                        other humans live, as long as they did their labor.<br><br>

                        When Meakrix returned to the dragon society the problem of free will was still as
                        present as ever. It was impossible to keep all humans in check. With time, free will
                        had moved on to many more laborers than before. Furious that Neban had not managed to
                        change anything during all these years, Meakrix challenged Neban to a duel over the
                        leadership of their society. The two fought at the same location as Vis and Meakrix
                        had before. But Neban did not fight with honor. Unbeknownst to the other dragons,
                        Meakrix was murdered while sleeping. Neban was hailed as the victor and stayed the
                        leader.<br><br>

                        Once in a while humans formed rebellious groups and attacked the dragons. It seemed
                        unthinkable that they did not want to be led by the dragons. Dragons were the most
                        powerful, wisest and most beautiful creatures on Earth. They were also the first,
                        conceived by Meiva itself. It was obvious that they were the world's rulers. To them,
                        it was but a fact. How humans could question this logic the dragons just could not
                        fathom. Dragons were on a whole different level. A human could never dream of
                        defeating a dragon. Yet, one dragon realized the truth. Oslan, later known as The
                        Watcher of Dreams, had a revelation. It was because of the free will. Since humans
                        now possessed this tool they could think, not just like a primitive, but as a dragon.
                        Humans did not understand when they themselves thought of themselves as on the same
                        level as the dragons. Oslan became frightened by this thought. Humans could perhaps
                        even learn something as pure as magic. Oslan believed the humans would one day turn
                        on their leaders. However, Neban dismissed these ramblings. In anger, Oslan, decided
                        to take a look in to Neban's mind. There it was revealed, the betrayal and murder of
                        Meakrix. And so Neban was banished, but unlike its predecessor, it was to last until
                        the end of time.</p>

                    <h3>The Final Years</h3>
                    <p>At the moment the dragons became leaderless once again, humanity struck. A huge war
                        between slaves and masters. With no one to guide them, the dragons turned confused.
                        Many were killed. Many fled, scattering across the lands. Oslan buried itself deep
                        below ground, where no man would ever search, never to be seen or heard from again.
                        It was a clear victory for the race of men. Now they were the masters.<br><br>

                        At the dawn of the new age the remaining dragons gathered. For the first time in their
                        existence, they turned their heads towards the skies, and they prayed. Yet, no one
                        answered.
