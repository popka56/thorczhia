                        <h2>What is Thorczhia?</h2>
                        <p>
                            Thorczhia is a vast and fantastical world of gods and dwarves, of dragons and men, of magic and secrets. 
                            Its lands are of many flavours, and the sea of many voices. No one could ever hope to explore it all, 
                            experience it all, in a single lifetime. Partum created it, Meiva oversees it, and Bekilip will at the 
                            end of it all destroy it. So the legend says, so it was told by The First One.<br><br>

                            The name Thorczhia is of ancient dwarvish, meaning 'Land and Sea'. It was a term mostly used to describe 
                            something being of both land and sea. The dwarves saw themselves as beings born from the chaos inbetween 
                            the violent waves and the solid rocks along the shores of Fewki. They were the first known humans walking 
                            on the surface, the first to explore the world, and they were the ones naming this world.<br><br>

                            This world of land and sea contains many regions with different countries, cultures and history. 
                            Thorczhia's surface is split into nine regions, called Luhs. Deep underground, in the Abyss, lies seven 
                            other regions inhabited by the demons, called Rhiels. Luhs are watched over by the Human Deities and the
                            Holy Circle, gods who observe and seek to only interact with humans when it is sorely needed. Below in 
                            the Rhiels however, the Lords of the Abyss, the gods of demons, rule with an iron fist. Only avoiding
                            conflict when they are desperate.<br><br>

                            The world of Thorczhia harbors a great secret. One only known to the gods and a select few. It is forbidden 
                            to speak about it. Forbidden to write it or even think it. This one secret cannot be told here. Yet, one may
                            gain the insight of the truth by reading between the lines of the pages. Will the secret reveal itself to 
                            you, dear reader? Only time will tell.
