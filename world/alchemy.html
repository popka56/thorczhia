                    <h2>Alchemy</h2>
                    <p>Alchemy is one of the oldest forms of science in Thorczhia. It prospered for a long time in Gircish, but 
                        with the discovery of magic, it became a less and less popular practice. The veteran alchemists would 
                        dismiss magic as 'non-science' for years. Today, magic is considered to be just as real as alchemy, but 
                        alchemy itself is no longer used as much. This is mostly because you can do the same things with magic, 
                        in less time and with less precision. Alchemy is still a big part of the culture of Gircish, and an 
                        important part of history, but these days it is almost exclusively used for medicine. Anyone can keep 
                        some alchemy-made medicine at home, but few can cast a spell of healing in a dire situation.
