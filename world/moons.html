                    <h2>Moons</h2>
                    <p>Thorczhia has three moons, all of varying sizes and color. They are all 
                        large bodies circling the world in approximately 10 hours within the 
                        illusion of heaven. They are both smaller and closer to the surface 
                        than the sun. The moons were originally created by Partum, but a 
                        common misconception is that they were created by Meiva, just like the 
                        sun and the illusions of heaven and space.<br><br>
                    
                        According to the people of Oqpa, the moons are spirits of the elements, 
                        representing wind, water and fire.</p>
                    <h2 id="silver-moon">The Silver Moon</h2>
                    <p>The smallest moon. It glows like silver during nighttime, hence the name.</p>
                    <h2 id="azure-moon">The Azure Moon</h2>
                    <p>It is blue like a crystal. The azure moon is seen as the wife to the sun 
                        according to dosatsu.</p>
                    <h2 id="crimson-moon">The Crimson Moon</h2>
                    <p>The largest moon. It got its name from how its color is red like blood.</p>
