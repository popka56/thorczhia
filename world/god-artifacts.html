                    <h2>Known God Artifacts</h2>
                    <p>God Artifacts are items created by gods, imbued with their power. These artifacts exists on 
                        a higher plane of existance, just like gods themselves, and are therefore among the only 
                        known things that can harm a deity. Long ago, the gods created many of these artifacts 
                        to reward heroes and rulers of the world. Eventually, the gods grew weary of all these 
                        powerful items, they started to look like a threat to their own power. And so, the gods 
                        began collecting them and threw them into a volcano until almost none remained.
