                    <h2>Known Ascendant Artifacts</h2>
                    <p>Much like God Artifacts, Ascendant Artifacts are items that exist on a higher plane of existance. 
                        But, unlike God Artifacts, Ascendant Artifacts were not originally created by a deity. These 
                        artifacts have instead ascended to this plane through great ordeal.

                        along with his body at his death. But his soul still lingers to the blade,
