                <h2>Non-Human Races</h2>
                <p>In Thorczhia there are many different creatures. Just like the human races, all creatures evolved through the 
                    many thousands of years were the dragons had their slaves, with some few exceptions that were born by other 
                    means or after their reign was over.<br><br>
                    
                    The following list is of the most infamous non-human races that have ever lived in the world of Thorczhia.
                </p>
                <h3 id="dragons">Dragons</h3>
                <p>The first race to ever walk upon Thorczhia. The dragons were created by Meiva shortly after Partum and Bekilip 
                    had been sealed in their temples. They were made as a tribute to The First One, and thus made in its likeness.
                    The dragons ruled the world from the moment they came into existance and prospered for tens of thousands of 
                    years, until the human races revolted, and the First Age of Man began.<br><br>

                    Dragons are large lizard-like creatures, with huge wings on their back, and hard scales covering their bodies.
                    All dragons can spew dangerous breaths like fire, ice or poision. The color of a dragons' scales can be used to 
                    determine what will come out. Dragons are well known to be the most intelligent race in all of Thorczhia. All of 
                    their senses are much better than any human could ever expect to have. A dragon has never been recorded to die of 
                    old age, but has many times been seen dying of heartbreak and depression.<br><br>
                    
                    Ever since their demise to the human races the dragons have spent their time in hiding, many hiding all alone deep 
                    underground or high in the skies.<br><br>

                    A common misconception is that the dragons of Na'ak are indeed dragons. This is not the case. The dragons of Na'ak 
                    may look similar to real dragons, but lack the huge wings and cannot spew fire or other dangerous elements from their 
                    mouths. These 'dragons' are actually snakes that have long felt jealous of the real dragons and through many generations 
                    they grew in size and grew legs as well as learned to swim through air itself.
                </p>
                <h3 id="kobolds">Kobolds</h3>
                <p>Kobolds are humanoid dogs with fur of rock or steel (the former much more common). They were created, much like dragonfolk 
                    or demonkin, by dragons having children with a race different from their own. In this case, with titans.<br><br>
                    
                    Kobolds live in societies among mountainranges or in caves and usually never venture far from their home. Overall, they 
                    are a very friendly race but they can also be very vicious if provoked. The diet of kobolds consists of rocks and other 
                    minerals. Gems are considered a delicacy.
                </p>
                <h3 id="goblins">Goblins</h3>
                <p>There are many dark energies in the world. One such energy once corrupted an entire Halfling city. The Halflings who lived 
                    there turned green and lost all their hair. They were then shunned by other human races and driven away form their own 
                    homes. While a slight loss in intelligence had occured, these people remained largely the same. However, as time went on 
                    they became more and more savage. Today, these short, hairless green people are known as Goblins. They are still considered 
                    to be simple savages, yet in reality they are pretty smart and given enough time, can create machinations of almost equal 
                    quality as ordinary Halflings or Dwarfs.
                </p>
                <h3 id="orcs">Orcs</h3>
                <p>Orcs are closely related to Goblins, and share many similar features. Both have green skin and have no hair on their heads 
                    or on their face. However, Orcs are much taller, slightly taller than a normal Saldi. No one is certain how Orcs came to be 
                    but it is speculated they were born in a similar manner as Goblins, because of their similar features. Unlike Goblins, Orcs 
                    are truly savages. They care not for machinery or the arts. They hunt, they eat, they procreate, they sleep.
                </p>
                <h3 id="trolls">Trolls</h3>
                <p>Trolls are savage creatures resembling a humanoid. They have long arms and fingers but shorter legs and chubby feet. They are 
                    feared by humans, mostly because they tend to eat humans, especially young children or newborns.
                </p>
                <h3 id="drows">Drows</h3>
                <p>Drows, also known as dark elves, are corrupted Elves or Noble Elves. Their skin is dark and their eyes red and the hair 
                    on their head has turned black. Drows are clever assassins that lurks in the shadows. It was the Drows that first 
                    started using Undercommon as their official languague, and several other non-human races followed suit.<br><br>

                    Drows live in swamps or in places where evil energies are the strongest. They are very hostile against anything that 
                    is not a drow, or an elf in the process of becoming one. Like other blood-sucking creatures, Drows suck blood from 
                    Elves or Noble Elves to survive, and their victims (the ones that survive, that is) will get corrupted by their 
                    corrupted fangs and turn into another Drow themselves, losing their mind in the process.
                </p>
                <h3 id="giants">Giants</h3>
                <p>Giants are, as the name suggests, giant people. They are about three times the height of a normal Saldi but harbour 
                    much less intelligence and mostly live in small settlements in the wild, far off from human civilization. They are 
                    slow and barely speak, mostly communicating to eachother through grunts. They use simple tools, like clubs or spears 
                    to hunt and build huts. They are very aggressive against humans that trespass on their land.
                </p>
                <h3 id="titans">Titans</h3>
                <p>Titans are mountain-sized golemns, born from the magic of Meiva during the early time of dragons. They were created 
                    to protect the temples of Partum and Bekilip from anyone who had the wrong intentions. They went unused for so long 
                    that they eventually retreated to the seafloor, and most has remained inactive ever since.<br><br>

                    Last time titans were seen was when Bekilip was first reborn into the world. They came from the ocean and stayed 
                    guard around the temple of Partum until Bekilip later destroyed the whole Luh.
                </p>
                <h3 id="demons">Demons</h3>
                <p>Demons originated from the lowest of the low of slaves for the dragons during the early stages of the Age of Dragons. 
                    Slowly but surely they got corrupted, twisted and turned into insane monsters now known as demons. They hate humans 
                    more than anything. Something that stems from generations of jealosy and has now become a trait that their are born 
                    with.<br><br> 
                    
                    Demons live exclusively in the Abyss and many are resistant or even immune to fire, poision or other things often 
                    seen down there. Demons are born during mass orgies were demons gather to procreate, kill and eat eachother. Many 
                    demon babies are eaten just seconds after they are born. The ones that survive have to survive mostly on their own 
                    in a very harsch envoirment until they finally become imps after about a year. Imps later grow and become fully 
                    fledged demons after another couple years. All demons must pledge their life to one of the seven Abyssal Lords, 
                    or face extinction. They live to serve their lord, or die a gruesome death by their hands or wither away in the 
                    prison of Raknarokk.
