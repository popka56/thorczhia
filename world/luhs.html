                            constantly in motion because of the huge maelstrom surrounding the entire Luh.
                            The Temple of Meiva is located here, and is used as a meeting place for the gods.</p>

                            the ages Kirmer has been the Luh who has known peace the most, hence why it is also
                            known as the Land of Peace. Yet, despite the name, Kirmer is also where some of the
                            most brutal wars have taken place, like the three demon wars. Kirmer is also the
                            location for the Temple of Partum.</p>

                            of Bekilip was first built here, but has since been sealed up the the gods.</p>

                        <p>The birthplace of magic and alchemy. It is a place where nature is everything to its
                            inhabitants. Back when magic and alchemy was discovered, two factions were made. 
                            The ones who believed magic would be the future of humanity moved to Kirmer, where 
                            natural magic was the strongest, while the others who believed in alchemy being 
                            humanity's future stayed here. Many exotic animals and foods come from Gircish, 
                            including Felines, who originated from here.

                            The Precursors thrived here until their eventual demise, one that they had predicted.
                            Today the Precursor technology is used by all the people of Oqpa on a daily basis, even
                            if it is still not entirely understood and cannot be replicated. Oqpa is also the home of
                            the Pharao, as well as the world's most notorious pirates.

                        <p>Sissaro is the name of the largest volcano on Thorczhia. It has been inactive ever since
                            the Age of Man began. The volcano has been refurbished into a huge tinkertown; Sot.
                            The city of Sot used to be one of the richest and most inflentual cities in the world.
                            But its influence grows weaker for every passing year, and its brotherhood, the Mist has
                            disappeared. Some say it is for the better, others disagree. Smoke and steam and ash
                            still covers the skies above, making it seem as active of a volcano as any. It was here
                            that the dwarves first dug too deep, and awoke the dark creatures in Wer Oplin.</p>

                            humans living here live in the hundreds of tribes around the land. However, 
                            there is one larger island outside of the archipelego which is home to more 
                            modern towns and a capital city. These people have made it a point to preserve 
                            the nature and tribes that live in the Luh.</p>

                            so long that none live to remember what started it. The Shogun of Iikomora,
                            Wu Han, was the one to finally bring an end to the never-ending conflict. Now,
                            peace has reached the kingdoms and a new era for the Luh has just begun.</p>

                            extending all the way up to Heaven, or so it is said. No one who has tried to
                            climb it has ever returned. The legend says the island is protected by three
                            guardians; The Great Serpent Lykladi, World's Wisdom Nosaamur and the King of
                            the Skies Krer.</p>
