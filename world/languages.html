                <h2>Languages</h2>
                <p>There are many languages in the world of Thorczhia and many different people and races that speak them. Here follows 
                    a list of all known languagues with descriptions about who speak them.
                </p>
                <h3 id="precursor">Precursor</h3>
                <p>Typical speakers: Linguists & historians.<br><br>
                    The predecessor to Common. It was spoken by the ancient people of Oqpa a long time ago. Its writing can be found on 
                    many of their ruins and on many ancient machinations, even those used today. Many who grew up on Oqpa know some words 
                    or phrases of the languague.
                </p>
                <h3 id="common">Common</h3>
                <p>Typical speakers: All the Human Races.<br><br>
                    The most spoken languague in Thorczhia. It is spoken by almost everyone, even Non-human races may sometimes know it.
                </p>
                <h3 id="undercommon">Undercommon</h3>
                <p>Typical speakers: Drows.<br><br>
                    While mainly spoken by Drows, many Non-human races choose to speak it over their own in certain situations. Especially 
                    with Humans, as Common and Undercommon share many similarities. Knowing one of the two allows you to easily understand 
                    the other if it is spoken to you.
                </p>
                <h3 id="nak">Nak</h3>
                <p>Typical speakers: Humans of Na'ak.<br><br>
                    The people of Na'ak were long disconnected from the rest of the world, because of the long war, and developed their own 
                    languague instead of speaking Common. Almost none on Na'ak can speak Common, but it is becoming more and more common now 
                    that the war is over. However, Nak is still seen as the primary languague.
                </p>
                <h3 id="dwarvish">Dwarvish</h3>
                <p>Typical speakers: Dwarves.<br><br>
                    The new dwarven languague established some time after the Titan War. Dwarves hate to write and read and tries to avoid it 
                    at all cost. Thus, Dwarvish is mostly only ever spoken, and because of that, is a very hard languague to study or learn 
                    if you are not born a dwarf in a dwarven society. It is common to carve names of people or objects in rock or metal as a 
                    form of honor, but beyond that, the only time dwarvish is ever written is in letters consisting of not more than a single 
                    sentance. Dwarvish has a letter that establishes either a question or statement, and the sentance follows thereafter. It 
                    can be noted that letters are only written and sent in cases of emergency, mostly among nobles or kings in times of war.
                </p>
                <h3 id="ancient-dwarvish">Ancient Dwarvish</h3>
                <p>Typical speakers: Linguists & historians.<br><br>
                    No one has uttered Ancient Dwarvish since the Titan War. After the war, the dwarves wanted to enter a new age togerther, 
                    and leave all the hardships behind, and so, chose to also stop speaking in their common tongue, adapting Common as their 
                    new primary languague. Yet with time, a new revised version of the languague slowly crept up.
                </p>
                <h3 id="ancient-elvish">Ancient Elvish</h3>
                <p>Typical speakers: None.<br><br>
                    Also known as the languague of the Atelya. It has since been lost to time, and none live today that know it. Only a select 
                    few words have ever been documented.
                </p>
                <h3 id="elvish">Elvish</h3>
                <p>Typical speakers: Noble Elves, Elves & Half-elves.<br><br>
                    The common languague for all kinds of Elves. Noble Elves speak it with a certain accent, considered to be slightly more 
                    dignified than the accent used by "normal" Elves and Half-elves.
                </p>
                <h3 id="halfling">Halfling</h3>
                <p>Typical speakers: Halflings.<br><br>
                    Halflings have their own languague that is rarely used anymore. Most still learn it as they grow up, but there is very 
                    little use for it in practice. Since Halflings often live together with other humans Common is much more practical.
                </p>
                <h3 id="myao">Myao</h3>
                <p>Typical speakers: Felines, most animals.<br><br>
                    Most animals speak Myao, Felines being the only Human Race that know it. It is nearly impossble for other humans to 
                    learn it as the concept of animal speech seems like just gibberish to most.
                </p>
                <h3 id="orcish">Orcish</h3>
                <p>Typical speakers: Orcs, Goblins, Hobgoblins.<br><br>
                    Orcish is like a scrambled version of Elvish, with a strong accent, making it hard for Elves to understand. Only a very 
                    keen eared Elf can make out some of the words and make meaning out of Orcish.
                </p>
                <h3 id="troll">Troll</h3>
                <p>Typical speakers: Trolls, Giants.<br><br>
                    Troll is a languague with few words. There are almost none who speak it beyond Trolls or Giants, making it hard to study 
                    for Human Races.
                </p>
                <h3 id="demon-speech">Demon Speech</h3>
                <p>Typical speakers: Demons, creatures from the Abyss.<br><br>
                    Demon Speech is the languague of the Abyss. All demons speak it, including other monsters and terrible creatures the 
                    live in or near the Abyss.
                </p>
                <h3 id="infernal">Infernal</h3>
                <p>Typical speakers: Demonkin, abyssal worshippers.<br><br>
                    Infernal is the main languague for Demonkin, but is also often spoken by cultists and demon worshippers.
                </p>
                <h3 id="snake-tongue">Snake Tongue</h3>
                <p>Typical speakers: Dragonfolk, snakes, Lizardmen.<br><br>
                    Most races with a snake tongue can speak the languague with the same name.
                </p>
                <h3 id="dragon-tongue">Dragon Tongue</h3>
                <p>Typical speakers: Dragons.<br><br>
                    Dragon Tongue is the first languague that was ever developed in the world of Thorczhia. It was made by the first dragons 
                    in three days and the languague has seen some few iterations over the thousands of years it has existed to account for 
                    new words and concepts that has come into existance since its inception.
                </p>
                <h3 id="kobold">Kobold</h3>
                <p>Typical speakers: Kobolds.<br><br>
                    Kobold is a languague universally understood by Dragons and many Dragonfolk, Lizardmen and snakes. To others it is just 
                    as much gibberish as the way animals speak. Is it spoken by making the infamous Kobold noise over and over.
                </p>
                <h3 id="elemental">Elemental</h3>
                <p>Typical speakers: Elementals, Ghosts.<br><br>
                    Elemental is a languague that cannot be heard by Human ears. It is spoken through the minds of the elementals or ghosts 
                    and only one well versed in magic or necromancy could understand it.
                </p>
                <h3 id="windtune">Windtune</h3>
                <p>Typical speakers: Windfarers.<br><br>
                    Windfarers are people who can travel with the wind by tuning their lifeforce to it. These people have also learned to 
                    communicate through the "song" of wind itself.
                </p>
                <h3 id="deep-speech">Deep Speech</h3>
                <p>Typical speakers: Deep sea creatures & creatures far below ground.<br><br>
                    To hear the languague of the creatures of the Deep is to hear madness incarnate. Few Human Races can hear its sound 
                    without losing their minds.
                </p>
                <h3 id="celestial">Celestial</h3>
                <p>Typical speakers: Gods, Angels.<br><br>
                    The Gods of Thorczhia, as well as their protectors, the Angels, have a unique languague spoken exclusively by them. 
                    It is literally impossible for a mortal to ever understand its words.
                </p>
                <h3 id="cosmic">Cosmic</h3>
                <p>Typical speakers: None<br><br>
                    Cosmic is a hypothetical languague made up by scholars. It is the idea of a languague that anyone can understand, 
                    and allows you to understand all languagues spoken to you as well. Anyone that achives True Enlightment, supposedly, 
                    should be able to speak this languague, according to high profile wizards.
