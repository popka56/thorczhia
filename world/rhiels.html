                        <p>This is the place most humans think of when they hear "The Abyss". It is 
                            a place of lava, fires and rocks hot enough to burn your shoes of in 
                            seconds. Annaxxor is the ruler of the Inferno, and he owns several 
                            portals that are used to transport demons to the surface. This is where 
                            the demons during the demon wars came from. This is also why Anaxxor's 
                            brood is mostly seen as the stereotypical demons amongst humans.

                        <p>In the deepest part of The Abyss lies The Depths. This place is completely 
                            devoid of light and all demons here are blind or possess darkvision. Down 
                            here lies a prison, sharing the name of its creator, Raknarokk. Heretical 
                            demons, and the occasional half-demon, are thrown in its pits, and locked 
                            behind thick steel gates, only to live in a constant darkness until the 
                            day they die. Hundreds of demons are forced to live in the pits together, 
                            and the weak ones usually get stomped or eaten within minutes.

                        <p>The ruins of an ancient city once ruled by the dragons. Once their reign 
                            ended the demons that lived there began breeding, destroying and killing 
                            indiscriminately. As such, the city went to ruins, and all that remained 
                            was chaos. Oorieria was the first to try and stop the sensless chaos. In 
                            time, this made her respected by the others, and she eventually became 
                            their queen, and god. Now, the ruins of the once great city is the home 
                            for the oldest and wisest of all demons, and they have devoted their lives 
                            to protect their queen, their god, Oorieria.

                        <p>This desolate place is covered in a green mist. Inhaling it would make any 
                            man sick with multiple diseases. The demons that live here are highly poision 
                            resistant. They creep underground, listeneing, waiting for their next meal. 
                            Any stray creature that wanders into their soil will soon die by sickness. 
                            Once their body starts to rot, they come, rip it apart and consume its flesh. 
                            They do it for their love for their lord, Crûdomo, the tormentor. They live 
                            for the pain he inflicts. They live for the pain of their meals.

                            <p>The Abyssal Lord Skorma was named monarch by the leaderless demons 
                                living in this rhiel. They heard his words and saw his actions, and 
                                they were smitten by it. Here there are no rules, no leadership, no 
                                dreams and goals. Strength is everything. The strongest survive, the 
                                weak die. It is as it should be, and all who are weak welcome death 
                                with open arms. You accept your fate, and use it to let the true 
                                survivors of this world become even stronger, getting closer and 
                                closer to perfection. Only the perfect demon will stand on top at 
                                the very end of it all.
