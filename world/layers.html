                        <h2 id="#surface">Surface</h2>
                        <p>The surface of Thorczhia is where most of its living creatures and plantlife exists.</p>

                        <h2 id="#wer-oplin">Wer Oplin</h2>
                        <p>Far below, deep in the earth is Wer Oplin. It is a cold and dark place of dark creatues.
                            The tempereature down here is far below freezing point, it takes only a few seconds for 
                            a human to turn into an ice statue. However, once you get closer to the Abyss the 
                            temperature will rise again.<br><br>

                            Wer Oplin used to be completely devoid of life, but once the dwarves began digging into 
                            the mountains they eventually hit this layer. And when they did, they awoke the dark 
                            creatues that had been sleeping there since time immemorial.</p>

                        <h2 id="#abyss">The Abyss</h2>
                        <p>The home of all demons. It is a huge open tunnel that serves as the layer between Wer 
                            Oplin and Wer Ssifisv. The Abyss is made of red rock and contains seas of lava, 
                            magical crystals and hordes and hordes of evil demons just waiting for their moment 
                            to return to the surface to kill all humans.<br><br>
                        
                            The Abyss is split into seven regions called Rhiels. Each of these Rhiels is ruled
                            by one of the Abyssal Lords.</p>

                        <h2 id="#wer-ssifisv">Wer Ssifisv</h2>
                        <p>Wer Ssifisv, like Wer Oplin, is extremely cold. And this layer gets even colder as 
                            you get deeper. No humans have ever ventured into these depths, and no other 
                            beings could exist under such harsch circumstances.</p>

                        <h2 id="#void">The Void</h2>
                        <p>The archmages of Kirmer have long studied the very center of the planet. It is large, 
                            and constantly growing. One day it will consume it all, as it destroys everything in 
                            its path. They named it The Void, and unless they find a way to stop it, it will be
                            the end for Thorczhia, albeit in a few tens of thousands of years in the future.</p>
