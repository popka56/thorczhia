                            <h2 id="human-deities">Human Deities</h2>
                            <p>The Human Deities (also known as The Dwarven Gods) are said to be the first living beings to
                                    ascend their souls to godhood in Thorczhia. These deities are by far the most popular gods among
                                    all the intelligent races in the world.</p>
            
                            <h2 id="human-deities-origin">Origin</h2>
                            <p>Before these deities ascended to godhood, they were all fierce rulers in the 14 kingdoms of
                                    Fewki. They were hated and feared by their people, just as they feared and hated each other.
                                    There was a constant war between these 14 kingdoms with no end in sight. One day, a magical
                                    gemstone was unearthed by one of the kings. This stone had the capabilities of granting anyone
                                    seemingly unlimited physical strength as well as magical prowess. Once the other kings and
                                    queens found out, it became a violent race to obtain the stone from the king who found it. But
                                    with their new powers, they seemed unstoppable. So, the other 13 rulers came together and
                                    created a plan to defeat and obtain the stone themselves. The plan was a success, and the 14th
                                    king was killed. Now, the remaining kings and queens would argue over the right to the stone,
                                    eventually all reaching out and placing their hands on it together. The surge of power that came
                                    rushing was so great it broke the entire Luh in 14 pieces, perfectly breaking apart along the
                                    borders of the kingdoms. The gem itself exploded, and its four pieces spread across the world.
                                    The rulers saw this as a sign that they were all worthy of such power and that they should not
                                    fight anymore. They made the center piece, the kingdom which belonged to the 14th king, their
                                    neutral ground, were they could hold meetings and the like.<br><br>
            
                                    With their souls now ascended the kings and queens felt changed, in more ways than one. They
                                    began calling themselves gods and became even more violent rulers over their own kingdoms than
                                    before, leveling entire cities and causing natural disasters all over the world as threats. For
                                    a time, it seemed as though these 'gods' were going to cause the end of the world. However,
                                    eventually they collectively realized they could not rule a world that did not exist. Together
                                    they made up rules as to how and when they were allowed to use their powers. Yet, all did not
                                    agree to these rules. Zaksi did not want to be limited in his use of his own powers and betrayed
                                    the rest. As punishment the other gods summoned an eternal maelstrom around all the 14 pieces of
                                    Fewki and sank Zaksi's kingdom to the bottom of the sea. Then, they sealed Zaksi and his kingdom
                                    together in a powerful magical prison at the dark seafloor.<br><br>
            
                                    As this all happened, completely oblivious to the gods, the people of Fewki tried to flee. No
                                    one could stand living in fear of these powerful beings any longer. Most people either died on
                                    their way away from the cities, or at sea. Only after the fact did the gods notice, and once
                                    they did it became the catalyst for their real change into gods. At this point Meiva intervened.
                                    They had visions of all the pain and suffering they had caused, they felt it, lived it, over and
                                    over in their minds. These powers could instead be used for good, is what they told each other
                                    during their last meeting as rulers.<br><br>
            
                                    Each of them then raised a temple to represent who they had now become on their former kingdoms.
                                    Finally, the kingdom of the 14th had a huge temple built for all of them, one that would welcome
                                    anyone to have an audience with them. They would become guides, wish granters and teachers. It
                                    was named after the one who had granted them thier visions; it was named The Temple of Meiva.
                                    They would lead the world to prosperity.</p>
            
                        <h2 id="human-deities-namesake">Namesake</h2>
                        <p>The Human Deities were all originally dwarves and are therefore also commonly referred to as The
                                    Dwarven Gods by the human races (especially dwarves themselves). Other non-human races know them
                                    instead most commonly as The 13 Deities of Fewki but also use the term 'Human Deities' when
                                    describing them.<br>
            
                                    As the gods were born during the early stages of human history their names stem from ancient
                                    dwarvish and corresponds to what they, as gods, stood for among their people at their creation.
                                    Some non-human races may use other words to describe them (particularly drows).</p>
            
                        <h2 id="human-deities-list">The Deities</h2>
                        <p>All The Human Deities each have their own personal temple, as well as a collective one, on Fewki.
                                    Anyone is free to have an audience with them, if they can prove themselves worthy by actually
                                    traversing the treacherous maelstrom surrounding it. The World Government always have their
                                    meetings in the collective temple, often with the gods as an audience. The most prominent
                                    feature that define the human deities is their size and the wings that sprout from their backs.
                                    They are all about the size of giants and each deity has their own unique pair of wings unlike
                                    the rest.</p>

                                    hardly ever worshiped by humans. Because of this, there is no common depiction of this god.
                                    Zaksi is the god of secrets and is said to have the answer to all questions. However, he is also
