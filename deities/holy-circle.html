                                <p>The Holy Circle, also known as The Holy Seven (and previously known as The Holy Six), is a group
                                    of deities officially recognized by humans. They were all once normal humans themselves and
                                    achieved godhood through some incredible feat or heroic deed. As of the Third Age these gods
                                    have become even more popular than The Human Deities among the human races.</p>
