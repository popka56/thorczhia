                        <h2>What are 'Gods'?</h2>
                        <p>In the realm of Thorczhia, the word 'god' is interchangable with the word 'ascendant'. All the
                            deities of the realm were once normal mortal beings, like yourself. To become ascendant, ones
                            soul must achive a higher level of existance. Anyone can do it, everything with a soul has the
                            potential to reach it, even everyday objects. This could be achived in a myriad of ways. To
                            know the nature of their powers is to know the realm itself.<br><br>
    
                            Only an ascendant can harm another ascendant. Mortals cannot hope to even scratch them. However,
                            some mortals were smart enough to use ascendant weapons in order to kill unaware gods. Yet, if
                            ascendant being is killed, their souls will remain. An ascendant soul is utterly indestructable.
                            An ascendant soul is the flame of ones heart. Touching it tells you everything about the person
                            it used to be. All its memories and feelings will come rushing into your mind. And if you wish
                            it, you may absorb an ascendant soul into your own, merging them together into a new creation.
                            This is one way one could become a god. Granted, you will no longer be yourself, but a fusion
                            of the person the soul belonged to and yourself.<br><br>
    
                            You may also achive godhood by straining your soul to its outmost limit time and time again,
                            slowly making it stronger over time. It works just like a muscle. This is also how ascendant
                            weapons are created. They are used in countless battles, killing hundreds of thousands of
                            people, beasts and other horrid creatures. Ascendant objects will gain a will of their own
                            when they achive godhood, and are therefore mostly thought to be cursed items by the people
                            who come into contact with it.<br><br>
    
                            All deities possess a set of supernatural abilities. These consist of, but are not limited
                            to, looking through the eyes of mortals, telepathy, shapeshifting, ghost projecting and
                            pact-making. With time, most deities develop their own, unique set of powers in addition
                            to these abilities.</p>
