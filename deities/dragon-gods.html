                        <p>The Dragon Gods are the ones responsible for the creation and the eventual destruction of the
                            world. They are keepers of peace and chaos both, neither good nor bad by the dragon's
                            standards.
                            These deities are three in number, but a fourth has long been known to have existed long
                            ago.
                            The dragon gods are also the one and only exception to the rule of ascendant beings. Their
                            souls
                            are on an even higher plane of existance than even ascendant beings. However, they are still
                            referred to as such.</p>

                        <h2 id="dragon-gods-history">Known History</h2>
                        <p>Once, it is told, Partum created the world of Thorczhia. Bekilip then tried to destroy it,
                            but
                            was stopped by Meiva, who removed the souls of its older siblings and locked them away in
                            their own personal prisons on the world itself. Their bodies were then lost to time in the
                            deep corners of The Nothingness. Meiva later created the dragons and their slaves, who later
                            became the rest of the races and animals of the world. Finally, Meiva watched over the world
                            among the dragons in a new vessel, one that matched the other dragons. It hid there as one
                            of them, until the great age of man begun.<br><br>

                            Many thousand years later, Meiva revealed itself to the public after creating a powerful
                            magical barrier around Bekilip's new form that was going rampage on Fol Palurin, Kirmer
                            during the Third Age. At this point in time, Meiva had a new vessel, one in the form of a
                            common male dwarf; Gerry Meiva. In a historical moment later referred to as The Meeting of
                            the Kirmer Incident the ancient history of the three Dragon Gods was revealed to The Humans
                            Races. After this meeting, the current dwarven emperor killed and absorbed the soul of
                            Bekilip, while simultaneously releasing the soul of Partum into the wild. Another male
                            dwarf, chosen by Meiva, then did the same with the soul of Partum, creating two new Dragon
                            Gods in the process; Charles Partum and Glakkonlir Bekilip. Once the defeat of Bekilip had
                            come, its soul was last seen taken by the other two gods, "to a place where no one is ever
                            going to find it and abuse its power again" (as told by the slayers of Bekilip).</p>

                        <h2 id="dragon-gods-followers">Followers</h2>
                        <p>The dragons of the world have always followed no other gods but The Dragons Gods, hence
                            the name.<br>

                            The Humans Races have officially recognized them as true deities following the incident
                            with Bekilip's reemerge and defeat during the Third Age, Year 201. Although, it is still
                            very rare to see races other than the dragons themselves who are truly loyal to these
                            original deities. Yet, quite a few dragonfolk have recently begun to follow them as
                            their main gods following the incident on Kirmer, although mostly in secret.</p>

                        <h2 id="dragon-gods-temples">Temples</h2>
                        <p>Each of the three dragon gods have a temple built for them. The first two, The Temple of
                            Partum and The Temple of Bekilip were raised by Meiva as prisons for their respective
                            god long ago. However, they later became their holy places for their followers.</p>

                        <h3 id="temple-partum">The Temple of Partum</h3>
                        <p>Partum's temple was once on a flying island chained to the icy tundra of For Palurin,
                            Kirmer. It was later destroyed when Bekilip reemerged during the Third Age. It has since
                            been rebuilt on The Large Back of For Palurin.</p>

                        <h3 id="temple-bekilip">The Temple of Bekilip</h3>
                        <p>Bekilip's temple was created deep underground on Skriiod. The entrance has now been
                            covered up and sealed with strong magic ever since Bekilip's reemerge during the Kirmer
                            incident.</p>

                        <h3 id="temple-meiva">The Temple of Meiva</h3>
                        <p>Meiva's temple was built by The Human Deities, in honor of being the one to show them
                            that their powers could be used for good deeds. This temple resides on Fewki and serves
                            as the meeting place for The World Government. Common folk may also visit this temple to
                            have an audience with any god(s) they please, however it is very dangerous to try to do
                            so because of the maelstrom always surrounding the land.</p>

                        <h2 id="dragon-gods-list">The Gods</h2>
                        <h3 id="partum">V:i.Partum</h3>
                        <p>The God of Creation and Rebirth. Is often depicted as a huge white dragon.</p>

                        <h3 id="bekilip">Bekilip</h3>
                        <p>The God of Destruction. Is recognized to eventually destroy the world one day, when the
                            time is right. Bekilip is by far the strongest of the three and could take both Partum
                            and Meiva on at once in a fight of brute strength. Is mostly depicted as a fierce red
                            dragon with a wingspan wider than any Luh.</p>

                        <h3 id="meiva">Meiva</h3>
                        <p>The God of Balance. More specifically, the balance between 'good' and 'evil'. Meiva lives
                            for the protection of the realm and its soul. Is considered to be the weakest among the
                            three gods, but the one with most respect from the dragons themselves. Is mostly
                            depicted as a normal-sized green dragon.</p>
