                        <p>Ever since what happened on Kirmer, with the souls of Partum and Bekilip fusing with
                            common dwarves, the Dragon Gods have unofficially become something other than before.
                            They now refer to themselves as the New Dragon Gods and have combined the names of their
                            dwarven vessels with their original dragon name. However, for others they are still just
                            called 'The Dragon Gods'. They all still stand for the same things and are depicted as
                            their former selves by dragons.</p>

                        <h3 id="charles">Charles Partum</h3>
                        <p>The new version of Partum, fused with a dwarf by the name of Charles Lincington. Wears
                            silver armor that gives of a glow like a rainbow when hit by light.</p>

                        <h3 id="gerry">Gerry Meiva</h3>
                        <p>A dwarf with the name of Gerry Gor'n fused with Meiva to create this new version. He
                            wears green plate armor decorated to look like dragon scale.</p>

                        <h3 id="glakkonlir">Glakkonlir Bekilip</h3>
                        <p>With Bekilip fusing with the dwarven emperor Glakkonlir Cadanak the result was the new
                            being Glakkonlir Bekilip. Once alive he wore a crimson set of traditional dwarven gear
                            and Glakkonlir's iconic high crown.</p>
