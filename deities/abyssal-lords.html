                                <h2 id="abyssal-lords">Abyssal Lords</h2>
                                <p>The Abyssal Lords are of the most powerful demons in all of Thorczhia. Lesser demons consider
                                    them their gods. They each rule over a Rhiel in The Abyss. An unspoken rule between the lords is
                                    to never reign over more than one Rhiel at a time. It is a rule that has been broken many times
                                    during the ages, however most believe it is the true way still. If an Abyssal Lord is killed by
                                    another lord, that lord may pick the demon to take its place. If a lesser demon kills a lord
                                    however, then that demon will become the new Abyssal Lord.</p>
            
                                <h2 id="lords-of-the-abyss">The Lords of the Abyss</h2>
                                <h3 id="anaxxor">XV:i. Anaxxor, Ruler of Inferno</h3>
                                <p>The big bad himself. Anaxxor is the most well-known and feared demon among humans on the surface.
                                    During the demon wars, it was Anaxxor's hordes that attacked first. Anaxxor owns several portals
                                    to the surface, and almost all demons who use them are of his own. He is very respected by all
                                    kinds of demons, and is even placed in very high regard by the other Abyssal Lords.</p>
            
                                <h3 id="raknarokk">Raknarokk, Lord of the Depths</h3>
                                <p>Deep within the pits lies Raknarokk and his demon prison by the same name. The name brings fear
                                    in
                                    demons and imps. Few humans know of him, but his prison has many legends and rumors echoing
                                    throughout the world. No one has ever seen Raknarokk's true form, except the other Abyssal
                                    Lords.
                                    Therefore, some demons question wheter or not he is just a fabrication to leave The Depths
                                    without
                                    a ruler.</p>
            
                                <h3 id="ooriera">Ooriera, Queen of Pandemonium</h3>
                                <p>The oldest and wisest of all demons. Demons never stop growing, and Ooriera has grown so much
                                    that
                                    all that remains is a huge lump of flesh, with a thousand eyes and hundreds of horns sticking
                                    out
                                    all over her body. She is completely immobile, and is constantly protected by her loyal
                                    children.
                                    However, she still possesses poweful magicks and is able to speak through others by controlling
                                    their minds.</p>
            
                                <h3 id="crûdomo">Crûdomo, The Tormentor</h3>
                                <p>The oldest demon next to Ooriera. However, Crûdomo knew what fate awaited him if he were to live
                                    too long. He did not want to become an immobile pile of flesh. His true love is pain, a life
                                    without inflicting pain onto others would not be one worth living, according to him. So, when
                                    Crûdomo was in his prime, he killed himself. Yet his soul still remains inhabiting his dead
                                    body.
                                    Crûdomo is now just a demon skeleton clad in black robes, still inflicting pain onto his
                                    children
                                    for all eternity.</p>
            
                                <h3 id="meerusô">Meerusô, Empress of Flame</h3>
                                <p>Also known as the Flame Demon-Witch. Meerusô has completely mastered the art of magical flames.
                                    She
                                    can manipulate and create almost any shape of fire. She and her domain is often wrapped
                                    completely
                                    in her own flaming walls and barriers, protecting it from other non-fire resistant demons.</p>
            
                                <h3 id="skorma">Skorma, Monarch of the Depraved</h3>
                                <p>Skorma believes life and death is one and the same. To live is to die. And dying means fulfilling
                                    your life. To Skorma, killing is an act of love, one which all his followers have accepted with
                                    open arms. Even the other Abyssal Lords find Skorma's philosopyh admirable, even if they
                                    themselves
                                    do not follow his vision. Skorma is seen as a primal demon, very dangeroues and unpredictable.
                                    His
                                    strength is bar none, even generally accepted by all Lords to be the strongest of them all.</p>
            
                                <h3 id="rû-Dôn">Rû-Dôn, The Fiendish King</h3>
                                <p>Rû-Dôn, the hornless demon, is often the butt of all jokes among the Abyssal Lords. He is not
                                    invited
                                    to their meetings and his name is often used to insult their own when they fail them. The
                                    reality is
                                    that Rû-Dôn is just quite mad and does not regard himself with others. </p>
